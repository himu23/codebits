/*
    process:
    -read the problem to understand it - (ask clarifying)
    -try think basically of differnet ways to solve the problem (start with bruteforce)
    -think end-end(E2E) of the best solutions based on complexity
    -write the algorithms from patterns in drawing
    -code it out
    -try and improve it once you think you're finished
    -go through other solutions(even if you answered correctly)
